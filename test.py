# If you need to turn it on again, you can call pulse_buzzer or start PWM with a specific duty cycle
# For example, you can restart buzzing:
pwm_10.duty_u16(32767)  # Set the buzzer to pulse again at 50% intensity
pwm_11.duty_u16(32767)
pwm_12.duty_u16(32767)
time.sleep(5)  # Let it buzz for 5 seconds
stop_buzzer()  # Ensure the buzzer is stopped
